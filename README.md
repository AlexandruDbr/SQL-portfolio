# SQL portfolio
In this repositiory you will find all the SQL projects I have worked from 2023-03 to 2024.02. This portfolio serves as proof of my proficiency in using Data Definition Language(DDL), Data Manipulation Language(DML), Data Query Language(DQL), Transaction Control Langauge(TCL) and SQL functions in data analysis and data manipulation.


### [1. Nashville Housing data cleaning project](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Nashville--Housing--Data--cleaning--SQL--project.git)

In this project I cleaned the data from a table called `NashvilleHousing` with SQL using Data Manipulation Language and Data Definition Language and string functions.

### [2. London bike sharing SQL data analysis](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/London-bike-sharing-data-analysis.git)
In this project I used SQL Data Manipulation Language and Data Query Langauge (such as Joins, Window functions, Case, Date functions, Aggregates, Alter Table) to analyse the records of public bicycle usage in London, UK from August 2023. The scope of analysis was to find more about station performance (i.e Which stations are most used) and cycling preferences(i.e ride time per bike model).

### [3. Analysis of real estate transactions from Connecticut, United states, January 2021](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/US_real_estate_SQL_proj.git)

The scope of this project is to used SQL modify, query and find insights in the data using DML commands (Data Manipulation Language), such as UPDATE and DELETE to modify or delete certain characters from the data source, DDL commands(Data Definition Language) such as ALTER TABLE to add new columns, and other commands (subqueries, date functions, aggreations, Case, CTEs, Temporary tables, Transactions) <br>
Also, I have used **Python** with **SQLAlchemy** and **Pandas** libraries to import data from a database, to append the new generated column to the data frame, and to export it into a .csv file. To extract the exact location I used  **geopy library** , based on two columns: Latitude and Longitude.

### [4. Social Media data analysis ](https://github.com/AlexandruDbr/Social-Media-SQL-project.git)

In this project I tried to create a small scale social media data base using Data Definition Language(Create, Insert, Update) and analyse user data using date functions, aggregation functions, and Data Query Language(Joins, subqueries, CTEs) and triggers. In the read me file of this repository are mentioned only Data Query commands, functions and a trigger, as this part is the core of this project.
